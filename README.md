# Angular2 Spotify/Youtube App

**Musify/IO** is a test of the new Angular2 TypeScript. It uses material design as a front-end framework along with Spotify and Youtube API as services to find, preview and play Music/Music video. No data are stored and No databases are used.

It might be updated in the future.
